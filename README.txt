These are the resources used to run a class at Stanford Splash entitled Understanding Diplomacy Through Wargaming. The game is a simulation of World War II, designed to be run for 16-50 players as a 4-hour class.

1) Motivations
The game is designed to teach lessons that I believe are important.
	a) Leadership and communication: the game is designed to be too complicated for any one student to understand, but with mechanics sufficiently siloed that students can interact with them independently. The key to performing well is being able to coordinate a team of domain-specific experts.
	b) The ability to work well under pressure: the game is stressful, with quick turns and many events occurring simultaneously. Every player has multiple demands for their time.
	c) Negotiation: this is the bulk of the game.
	d) Realpolitik, and the balance of powers: the theory lessons, which I believe are best understood by experiencing their importance oneself.

2) Materials
If you are interested in running the game itself, you will need the following materials. Most of these should be available at a local Staples.
	a) White Cardstock
	b) Colored Cardstock in ~16 different colors
	c) White paper
	e) Shipping Labels (Avery 8162 and Avery 5161)
	f) ~50 6-sided dice
	g) A paper cutter (and additional scissors)
	h) Optional: 16 folders to compile country packets
	i) ~200 small pieces of paper for orders. Post-it notes work well.
	j) A bell or the ability to shout
	k) ~30 3-5g plastic cosmetic jars, to hold large groups of units.

3) Printing
Printing can be expensive if you can't find someone to subsidize the cost. The following things need to be printed:
	a) WarGameSpring15.pdf, at least 16 copies on white paper
	b) States.pdf, at least 2 copies on white paper
	c) TurnChecklist.pdf At least 12 copies on white paper
	d) maps/ResourceMapEurope.pdf, 1.2 copies per player on white paper
	d) maps/ResourceMapWorld.pdf, 1.2 copies per player on white paper

	e) maps/GameBoardEurope.pdf, 1 copy in a large format, ~3-4' in the smaller direction.
	f) maps/GameBoardWorld.pdf, 1 copy in a large format,  ~3-4' in the smaller direction.
	g) Battles.pdf, 5 copies on white card stock. Number them 1 to 5.
	h) ResourceCards.pdf, ~10 Copies on colored card stock, using a different color for each resource.

	i) StateBadges.pdf, 1 copy on shipping labels.
	j) RoleBadges.pdf, 10 copies on shipping labels

	k) Units.pdf, 3 copies for each team and 1 copy for non-player powers on colored card stock.

3) Packets
Each team needs to start with the following things. They should be compiled into a packet and handed out randomly to groups of people.
	a) A couple copies of the maps so that even the largest team has an extra copy.
	b) 1 copy of the rules.
	c) 1 copy of the corresponding state sheet.
	d) All their starting resources.
	e) 1 copy of the state name badges.
	f) 1 copy of the sheet of role labels.

4) Run-time advice
	a) Assign 16 people to be presidents at game start. Try to pick the most mature players.
	b) Give everyone plenty of time to read and reread the rules. They need more time than they think they do.
	c) End the game on a random turn after ~3 hours into game or when countries start doing silly things. Nuclear weapons become available at turn 9, so try to have at least 10 turns. Later turns should be shorter than earlier turns.
	d) Feel free to deny any player requests that you like. You don't have to be nice to them.
	e) The game is unfair because reality was unfair. You don't need to compensate for this. If anything, encourage the smaller countries to work together.
	f) I may have missed things in this readme. Sanity check everything before game start.
	g) Players generally avoid cheating, unless they suspect someone else of cheating. Generally this is not a problem, but sometimes it can escalate. Making sure that resources are distributed correctly is the most important step in avoiding cheating.
	h) Try to understand the rules, or assign GMs to particular sections of the rules.
	i) Making players write down orders is important; it slows down gameplay, ensures that players are spending the correct resources, prevents problems from players simultaneously moving units, prevents team members who are not familiar with the unit-moving rules from violating them, and forces the players to commit. I generally did not read the orders, just accepted the piece of paper and asked the player to resolve it.

5) The javascript interface
There is a hacked-together script for automatically calculating resources production in web_interfaces/game.html. The script also can display in a new window, a dynamically updated map showing current territory ownership.
The script can be accessed directly online (https://rawgit.com/dwhalen/udtw/master/web_interface/game.html), although certain browsers may require that you download it and load the page locally.
